# dataAnalysis_stats
A collection of Jupyter notebooks created for a course on data analysis and statistics in physics and astronomy.

Assignment 1 focuses on deriving the joint probability density function of an exponential and a uniform random variable when convolved. Assignment 2 focuses on bayesian and frequentist hypothesis testing. Assignment 3 is an exploration of parameter space using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and assignment 4 is a more realistic example of how to predict the concentration of uranium being concealed within a sample of aluminum using only a radiation detector. It involves Monte Carlo methods, hypothesis testing,  and choosing the most reasonable test statistic.
